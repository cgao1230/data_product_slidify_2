## What is BMI?

* BMI is short for Body Mass Index. It is a meausre of relative weight based on an individual'smass and height.
* It has formula (in metric) $$ BMI=mass(kg)/(height(m)^2) $$
or the formula can be expressed in standard measure $$ BMI=mass(lbs)/(height(inch)^2) $$
*Just for your reference 1 feet = 12 inches

## Categories of BMI
A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height. There are variety of standards for categories of BMI. In this BMI calculator app, we use,
* less than 18.5: underweight
* greater than 18.5 and less than 24.9: normal
* greater than 24.9 and less than 30.0: overweight
* greater than 30.0: obesity

                numericInput('weight','Weight',1),
                selectInput("wt_unit", "Weight unit",c("lbs", "kgs")),
                numericInput('height','Height',1),
                selectInput("ht_unit", "Height unit",c("inches", "m")),
                submitButton('Calculate BMI')
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
                h4('Weight you entered:'),
                verbatimTextOutput("weight"),
                h4('Height you entered:'),
                verbatimTextOutput("height"),
                
                h4('Your BMI is '),
